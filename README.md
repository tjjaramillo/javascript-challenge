# javascript-challenge

Using a UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, this code appends a table to a web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. This code also provides multiple filters based off of user input from the web page for multiple categories (date/time, city, country, state, etc.) and displays the results in a table as well.
